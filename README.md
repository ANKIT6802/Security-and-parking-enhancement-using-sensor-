# Smart Parking System
This project is an IoT-enabled Smart Parking System that uses sensors to automatically manage customers, monitor entries to the parking space and track the number of available parking slots without the need for human labour. Moreover, the system also comes with a web-based interface that allows the manager to see the customer list, analyze collected data, change the passcode for the parking space and interact with the physical devices in real-time. <p align="center">
